# Static musl binary on scratch: no shell, no libc, no CVE surface. TLS is
# rustls + ring (bundled assembly), so nothing links against OpenSSL; the
# PostgreSQL verifies certificates and hostnames against this CA bundle (and
# optionally PGVS3_DB_CA_FILE for a private CA such as Amazon RDS).
#
# Build both architectures with `just image` (docker buildx). The builder
# image's Rust version should match or exceed mise.toml's; CI builds and tests
# natively first, so drift shows up as a failed check before the image builds.
# The Rust version here must be >= mise.toml's; CI runs `just ci` first, so
# drift shows up as a failed check, not a broken image.
